An introduction to the design, analysis, and implementation of data structures. This course
teaches you how to build, test, debug, document, and evaluate objects that encapsulate data
and their associated operations using programming constructs and data abstractions of a
modern programming language. Concepts and techniques covered include linear and non-linear
structures, recursive structures and algorithms, traversal algorithms, binary search trees,
balanced trees, priority queues, union-find, hash tables, Bloom filters, and graphs. We will also
informally compare and contrast the run time efficiency of algorithms and their performance
characteristics including the concept of worst-case running time analysis and the classification
of algorithms in terms of constant, logarithmic, linear, log linear, quadratic, and exponential time
using Big-O notation
